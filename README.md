# A software ecosystem for brain tractometry processing, analysis, and insight

Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to assess
the physical properties of long-range brain connections. Here, we present an
integrative ecosystem of software that performs all steps of tractometry:
post-processing of dMRI data, delineation of major white matter pathways, and
modeling of the tissue properties within them. This ecosystem also provides
tools to extract insights from these measurements: It includes novel
implementations of machine learning and statistical analysis methods that
consider the unique structure of tractometry data. Additionally, it offers
tools for visualization and interpretation of the results. Taken together,
these open-source software tools provide a comprehensive environment for the
analysis of dMRI data. We benchmark characteristic performance of these
statistical analysis methods in a range of different datasets and analysis
tasks, including hypothesis testing on group differences and predictive
analysis of subject age.
