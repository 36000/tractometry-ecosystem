  abstract  = "Introduction: The Human Connectome Project (HCP) has become a
               keystone dataset in human neuroscience, with a plethora of
               important applications in advancing brain imaging methods and an
               understanding of the human brain. We focused on tractometry of
               HCP diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data. Methods: We used an
               open-source software library (pyAFQ;
               https://yeatmanlab.github.io/pyAFQ) to perform probabilistic
               tractography and delineate the major white matter pathways in the
               HCP subjects that have a complete dMRI acquisition (n = 1,041).
               We used diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) to model white matter
               microstructure in each voxel of the white matter, and extracted
               tract profiles of DKI-derived tissue properties along the length
               of the tracts. We explored the empirical properties of the data:
               first, we assessed the heritability of DKI tissue properties
               using the known genetic linkage of the large number of twin pairs
               sampled in HCP. Second, we tested the ability of tractometry to
               serve as the basis for predictive models of individual
               characteristics (e.g., age, crystallized/fluid intelligence,
               reading ability, etc.), compared to local connectome features. To
               facilitate the exploration of the dataset we created a new
               web-based visualization tool and use this tool to visualize the
               data in the HCP tractometry dataset. Finally, we used the HCP
               dataset as a test-bed for a new technological innovation: the TRX
               file-format for representation of dMRI-based streamlines.
               Results: We released the processing outputs and tract profiles as
               a publicly available data resource through the AWS Open Data
               program's Open Neurodata repository. We found heritability as
               high as 0.9 for DKI-based metrics in some brain pathways. We also
               found that tractometry extracts as much useful information about
               individual differences as the local connectome method. We
               released a new web-based visualization tool for
               tractometry-``Tractoscope'' (https://nrdg.github.io/tractoscope).
               We found that the TRX files require considerably less disk
               space-a crucial attribute for large datasets like HCP. In
               addition, TRX incorporates a specification for grouping
               streamlines, further simplifying tractometry analysis.",

  abstract = "Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a
              method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts)
              in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an
              important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological
              disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically
              along each tract for several reasons: different populations of
              axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local
              positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding
              diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may
              reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and
              disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We
              demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in
              the brains of typically developing children and children at risk
              for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First,
              fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a
              tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects.
              Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean
              diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at
              specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along
              the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare
              white matter properties of individual patients to standardized
              Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique
              features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract
              Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white
              matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the
              preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA
              measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left
              superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the
              correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We
              introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract
              quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI
              parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation,
              AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical
              management and decision-making.",

  abstract = "The white matter contains long-range connections between
              different brain regions and the organization of these connections
              holds important implications for brain function in health and
              disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
              imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the
              trajectories of these connections. Statistical inference from
              tractometry usually either averages these quantities along the
              length of each fiber bundle or computes regression models
              separately for each point along every one of the bundles. These
              approaches are limited in their sensitivity, in the former case,
              or in their statistical power, in the latter. We developed a
              method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into
              account tissue properties along all of the bundles and selects
              informative features by enforcing both global and bundle-level
              sparsity. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two
              settings: i) in a classification setting, patients with
              amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are accurately distinguished
              from matched controls. Furthermore, SGL identifies the
              corticospinal tract as important for this classification,
              correctly finding the parts of the white matter known to be
              affected by the disease. ii) In a regression setting, SGL
              accurately predicts ``brain age.'' In this case, the weights are
              distributed throughout the white matter indicating that many
              different regions of the white matter change over the lifespan.
              Thus, SGL leverages the multivariate relationships between
              diffusion properties in multiple bundles to make accurate
              phenotypic predictions while simultaneously discovering the most
              relevant features of the white matter.",

  abstract = "Statistical models employed to test for group differences in
              quantized diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tracts often fail

              addition to the distribution, type, and interdependence of the
              data. To address these issues, we propose the use of Generalized
              Additive Models (GAMs) and supply code and examples to aid in
              their implementation. Specifically, using diffusion data from 73
              periadolescent clinically anxious and no-psychiatric-diagnosis
              control participants, we tested for group tract differences and
              show that a GAM allows for the identification of differences
              within a tract while accounting for the nature of the data as
              well as covariates and group factors. Further, we then used these
              tract differences to investigate their association with
              performance on a memory test. When comparing our high versus low
              anxiety groups, we observed a positive association between the
              left uncinate fasciculus and memory overgeneralization for
              negatively valenced stimuli. This same association was not
              evident in the right uncinate or anterior forceps. These findings
              illustrate that GAMs are well-suited for modeling diffusion data
              while accounting for various aspects of the data, and suggest
              that the adoption of GAMs will be a powerful investigatory tool
              for diffusion-weighted analyses.",
